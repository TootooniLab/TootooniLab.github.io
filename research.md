## AI IN DRUG DOSING DECISION MAKING IN CRITICAL CARE​
Vancomycin is an antibiotic used to treat infections caused by bacteria. A prescription is required to obtain the medication and cannot be bought over the counter. Prescribing too high of a dosage can cause harm to the kidneys or ears, which will result in longer hospital stays as well as higher mortality rates. Too low of a dosage may cause a antimicrobial resistance towards the medication, rendering the medicine useless towards the patient which can double the chances of developing a serious health condition and triples the chance of death. In this project, we collaborate with scholars from Mayo Clinic, Loyola University Chicago, University of Illinois Chicago, and University of Chicago and use their data to advance Artificial Intelligence (AI) Models to identify and design a plan for the correct dosage which then gets translated and sent to pharmacists and physicians to use.

## AI IN EARLY DETECTION OF EVENTS​
When a patient enters the emergency room, an assessment known as a triage must be done ​​to determine the severity of the need for treatment. After the deposition decision, a bed must be assigned to the patient which is where they will be stationed until the end of their visit. Ideally, the hospital admission process can be predicted so that the bed coordination can begin before the patient enters the ER, thus time is saved for the patient to be admitted. Our lab uses the chief complaints, given by the patient upon first arrival, which is submitted into Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to extract the concepts in the form of SNOMED-CT codes called SCTIDs. SCTIDs will then be mapped into CC groups which can be used on their own or be used in downstream processes such as resource allocation and clinical decision support.

## HEALTH DISPARITIES IN HYPERTENSION CONTROL​​
This project analyzes how the disparities in healthcare affect hypertensive patients. Differences in quality of healthcare can differ vastly based on who one is and where they live. With the help of Electronic Health Record data and Census data, we are able to run many tests to see how ones socioeconomic status can affect the healthcare received specifically for hypertensive patients. With the help of Geospatial analysis, we used PolicyMap and the Area Deprivation Index (ADI) to look for therapeutic inertia. From there, we can make connections as to how a certain area might have more or less inertia in relation to their socioeconomic status.

## SHIELD ILLINOIS​​
The SHIELD Illinois program was created to prevent COVID transmission and provide testing to communities in Illinois. It's impact on underrepresented populations and potential for guiding future pandemic response efforts however, require further investigation. Data from the SHIELD Illinois program, the Chicago Department of Public Health, and electronic health records from two major health centers in the Chicagoland area will be used alongside the COVID Community Vulnerability Index (CCVI) and the Area Deprivation Index (ADI) to determine how underrepresented communities benefit from the program. Our objective is to evaluate the effect of the SHIELD testing program on COVID severe outcomes such as admission to Intensive Care Unit (ICU), mechanical ventilation use, and death. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is then used to identify the most effective attributes related to the location of testing centers on the volume of the performed tests, which will provide guidance for future pandemic response planning.

## ECG AI RESEARCH​​
The United States has over 6 million adults suffering from heart failure, a condition with a high mortality rate and decreased quality of life. Early recognition and timely interventions are essential to reduce the risk of heart failure on individuals and the healthcare system as a whole. However, more than half of heart failure patients have preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (HFpEF), and current treatments mostly target reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFrEF). HFpEF is a heterogeneous syndrome with an unclear etiology, meaning that there are many causes for HFpEF and yet the causes are unclear. The goal of this project is to use artificial intelligence (AI) and electrocardiogram (ECG) data to predict incident HFpEF risk and subtype prevalent HFpEF in a cost-effective and accessible manner.
