**HIDS 431: Introduction to Natural Language Processing in Health**
Course Description:
​The objective of this course is to present a broad overview of methodologies to analyze and mine biomedical text automatically. Students will be exposed to some of the common and state-of-the-art software, algorithms and techniques to extract content and knowledge from biomedical texts. A particular emphasis will be placed on how these methodologies are used in the context of health care, clinical records and narratives, and how extracted information can be used to improve care.

**HIDS 422: Ontologies in Health**
Course Description:
​This course provides students with essential concepts of ontologies, building ontologies, and knowledge representation as they pertain to health care and biomedical research. With the ubiquitous nature of computer systems, and information-based systems in health care (and everywhere!) there is a critical need to be able to represent information in a manner that is understandable for a computing system. Thus, the course is inherently multidisciplinary, and at the intersection of philosophy, mathematical logic, artificial intelligence, and informatics. The course also presents how ontologies impact concept definition in health care, and the various coding systems in biomedical research.
