        I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Health Informatics and Data Science with a secondary appointment in the Center for Health Outcomes and Informatics Research at Loyola University Chicago. I received my PhD in Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISE) from Binghamton University in 2016. Prior to joining Loyola, I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Department of Health Sciences Research at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, for two years.
My research lies in the intersection of decision science and artificial intelligence, which furthers knowledge of monitoring of and predictive analytics for complex healthcare systems. I am particularly interested in the role of data science and Artificial Intelligence tools such as Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing in development of clinical decision support models. Having an Industrial and Systems Engineering background, I am also interested to apply systems thinking, quality assurance, and optimization principles to improve health outcomes. Furthermore, I teach courses such as ontologies (knowledge representation) in health and Natural Language Processing.

        My research focuses on the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms to prevent adverse health outcomes. I’m using Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform the field by extracting valuable insights from unstructured data, such as Electronic Health Records. By identifying crucial data points for population health management and clinical trials, I propose that LLMs can be helpful to facilitate the development of therapeutic Inertia.

        I am a graduate student with a BS in Biology at Loyola University Chicago, where I'm also pursuing a MS in Bioinformatics. I am currently a graduate intern in Dr. Tootooni's lab, where I am currently working on a project that analyzes the contributing factors of therapeutic inertia within elderly hypertensive patients. My specific role involves linking geospatial determinants of health to patient addresses at census boundary levels. This, along with further contextual information from other aspects of the project will provide insight into whether the geospatial features of the location in which a patient resides has any influence on the occurrence of therapeutic inertia.

        I am a Medical Student at Loyola University’s Stitch School of Medicine and my current project focuses on EMS-ED-Stroke. Life-saving treatments for strokes are time-sensitive and require rapid triage and transport to the appropriate stroke system of care. Prehospital data, recorded by Emergency Medical Services (EMS), can be used to develop early diagnosis tools, often using artificial intelligence (AI). By improving the quality and quantity of prehospital EMS data and ensuring its interoperability with Emergency Department (ED) data, AI-based clinical tools can be made more accurate, leading to earlier diagnosis of time-sensitive conditions such as stroke. Thus, I am excited for this project because we aim to characterize the availability and distributions of prehospital data, then examine the reliability of prehospital data by comparing EMS measurements with those acquired upon ED arrival.

        Hello everyone! I am an Undergraduate Student majoring in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at Lincoln University, Pa, and I’m currently working on this advanced development platform, GitHub, for Dr.Tootooni's Lab, analyzing the uses and benefits that it can provide in an academic lab. Also, to determine how much more efficient it would make academic research. This project will be focused on the key features—Issues, Wiki, and Branches, examining their uses and benefits in an academic lab. Though I am currently working on this project, I also have the opportunity to learn about everyone's research in the lab. It is such an amazing experience that broadens my horizon on the different fields of science and also teaches me a lot about data science and Artificial intelligence.

        Hello! I am currently a rising sophomore studying Biology at Loyola University Chicago's Lakeshore campus. The project that I am currently working on is the creation, organization, and management of the Tootooni lab website using the platform, Weebly, GitHub, and the official Loyola platform, Terminal 4. I will also be assisting Grant in his EMS-ED project by helping him sort out information on stroke hospitals​. Through making the website and interactions with the lab members, I have the chance to learn about all of their work. From understanding how Natural Language Processing works to Geospatial Analysis, I have gained a plethora of knowledge regarding everyone's work.
